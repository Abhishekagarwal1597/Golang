1- use make to create new array, which is most efficient way to create compare to other method.
Ex - 
myMap := make(map[string]int)
myMap := map[string]int{
    "apple":  1,
    "banana": 2,
    "orange": 3,
}

The for loop in Go is a fundamental control flow construct used to repeatedly execute a block of statements until a specified condition is met.
The basic syntax of a for loop in Go is as follows:
for initialization; condition; post {
    // statement(s)
}
